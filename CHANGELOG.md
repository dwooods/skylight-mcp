# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `create_routine`: create a weekly routine (morning, afternoon or evening) for one or more profiles, via the web app's `create_multiple` call. Weekly schedules only.
- `delete_chore` takes `scope`: `future` ("this and future tasks") or `all` ("all tasks in series"), sent as `apply_to`. Required for recurring chores and routines, which replaces the 1.8.3 refusal. It reads the chores back and reports whether the occurrence is gone.
- `update_chore` works on recurring chores and routines for a rename and for a weekly schedule (`days` + `timeOfDay`). Schedule changes need `acknowledgeReset: true` because they can reset streak history. Skylight re-keys the chore on every edit; the reply gives the new id.

### Changed
- `update_chore` on a recurring chore refuses date, time, assignee and stars (never captured) instead of guessing.

## [1.8.3] - 2026-10-31

### Changed
- `delete_chore` refuses occurrence ids of recurring chores and routines (like `12345-2026-11-03-0600`) and points to the app, because the delete scope ("this and future" vs "all in series") is not captured. One-off chores are unaffected.

### Fixed
- `get_reward_points` now names points held by non-profile categories (for example a shared "Household" bucket) and labels ids it cannot match `unknown profile (id)` instead of `profile <id>`.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-10-31

### Changed
- The hosted Worker now also offers `delete_chore`, `delete_list`, `delete_list_item`, `delete_reward`, `delete_recipe` and `delete_meal_sitting` (plus `delete_message`). `delete_calendar_event` stays local-only.
- **Behavior change:** `delete_chore`, `delete_list`, `delete_list_item`, `delete_reward` and `delete_recipe` now preview and delete nothing unless `confirm: true` (as `delete_meal_sitting` and `delete_message` already did). This applies to the local server too.

### Added
- `complete_chore`: mark one occurrence of a routine or recurring chore done, or undo it, via Skylight's completions endpoint. Previews unless `confirm: true` (it awards real stars and streaks). Available on both the local and hosted servers. One-off chores are refused until their payload is captured.
- `get_chores` prints `Routine: Yes` and `get_week_overview` tags `[routine]` for routines. A routine
  is a recurring chore with `routine: true` (captured from the web app's create call; "In the Morning"
  was `BYHOUR=6`; afternoon, evening and weekly values are not captured). Read-only marking; completing one is `complete_chore`; there is no tool
  to create a routine yet.

### Fixed
- `get_reward_points` showed `ID: undefined` and raw category ids; it now shows each profile's name, current balance and lifetime earned.
- `update_chore` no longer accepts a completion `status` (it used the wrong endpoint and value, so it never awarded stars). It refuses and points to `complete_chore`.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-10-31

### Fixed

- The client's request log (stderr, including during `doctor` and in MCP client logs) printed the full
  URL, so your frame ID appeared in terminals and pasted bug reports, contradicting the README's
  "never prints your frame ID". Logged URLs now show `/frames/<frame>`; the real request is unchanged.
  A test fails if the ID appears in any log line.

### Changed

- README: warns not to run `npx` from inside a clone of the repo and adds the error to Troubleshooting. Found publishing 1.8.0 from a Windows clone.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-10-31

### Fixed

- The credential-store tests asserted Unix file modes (0600/0700), which Windows does not report, so
  `vitest run` and therefore `npm publish` failed on any Windows clone. The mode checks now run on
  POSIX only; a deliberately loosened mode still fails them there. Found when publishing from Windows.
- `doctor` always failed its Skylight API check with "client has not been initialized": the
  real check used the process-wide client that only the server's startup sets up, and the tests
  replaced the check with a mock. It now builds its own client. Found on the first Windows run;
  not Windows-specific.
- On Windows the sign-in message said "credential file (0600)". Windows ignores Unix modes, so
  it now says the file is unencrypted and protected only by the Windows profile.
- A completed chore is reported by Skylight as `complete`; the tools compared against `completed`.
  `get_chores` with `status: completed` found nothing and `pending` listed done chores, and
  `get_week_overview` showed done chores as `[ ]` and as overdue. Both values now count as done.
  Not fixed here: `update_chore` still sends the old status value to a different endpoint than
  the web app's completion call (see build log).

### Changed

- **Behavior change:** profile names are now matched exactly (case-insensitive) everywhere:
  `create_chore`, `update_chore`, `get_chores` (assignee filter), `create_reward`,
  `redeem_reward`, and `from` on `send_message` / `update_message`. Previously a partial
  name such as "Alex" could resolve to "Alexander" and put the chore or message under the
  wrong person. An unknown or partial name now fails before any write and lists the valid
  profile names.
- `get_calendar_events` no longer prints `owner_email`, `calendar_id`,
  `calendar_account_id`, `invited_emails`, `uid` or `supports_notification_settings`.
  They identified accounts and people and gave a model nothing to act on. Other
  fields, including ones Skylight adds later, are still printed.

### Added

- **Up for Grabs chores**: chore reads now always ask Skylight for shared chores that anyone
  can take (the web app does; without it they were never returned). `get_chores` shows them as
  "Assigned to: nobody (up for grabs)" and `get_week_overview` labels them. Verified live with
  the Skylight toggle off only.
- `get_task_box` (read-only, available on the hosted server): lists the task box. Items are
  reusable chore and routine templates with no assignee or date, so a task saved there does
  not appear in `get_chores`. Shape captured from the web app; an unrecognised response is
  an error (top-level keys only), never "empty".
- `get_calendar_events` prints a `profiles:` line naming who an event is assigned to.
  The response field it reads (`relationships.categories`, or `category_ids`) is inferred
  from chores and messages and has not been confirmed on a real event.
- **Live test suite** (`npm run test:live`, development only). Real tools against a
  real frame, to catch drift in Skylight's undocumented API that mocked tests
  cannot see. Off unless `SKYLIGHT_LIVE=1`, never part of `npm test` or CI, and
  the harness refuses `send_message`, `update_message` and `delete_message`. One suite per file in
  `tests/live/`, filterable by tag. First suites: read smoke checks,
  response-shape contract checks, write guards and a meal
  create/rename/move/delete round trip with guaranteed cleanup. A normal-suite
  test checks that every live file is gated.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-10-30

### Changed

- npm package name is `@davidwoods/skylight-mcp` (the `dwooods` npm scope was not
  available; the GitHub repository is still `dwooods/skylight-mcp`).

### Added

- **`skylight-mcp doctor`**: checks Node, frame ID, timezone, sign-in and one real
  API call, and says what to fix. Never prints tokens or the frame ID. `--offline`
  skips the network call. It warns when `SKYLIGHT_TIMEZONE` is unset, because the
  default (America/New_York) silently shifts event times for everyone else.
- **`npm run worker:setup`**: one command to create your own hosted Worker (KV
  namespace, gitignored `wrangler.local.jsonc`, passphrase, `WORKER_URL`, deploy).
  `-- --dry-run` shows the steps. Not yet run against a real Cloudflare account.
- README quick start is now `npx` based (no clone), with a troubleshooting table.
- `package.json`: `publishConfig.access`, and `prepublishOnly` runs typecheck, lint,
  tests and build before any publish.

### Fixed

- Meal listing: Skylight's `date_max` leaves out the end day, so one-day queries
  returned nothing and ranges lost their last day (week overview too).
- `get_colors` and `get_reward_points` tolerate responses that are not plain
  JSON:API lists; an unrecognised shape fails with top-level keys only.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added

- **Messages**: `delete_message` (destructive) deletes a message with
  `DELETE /nudges/{id}`. The Skylight app has no delete button for messages; the
  call comes from other open-source clients and was verified on a real frame.
  It previews unless `confirm: true`, reads the list back and reports success only
  if the message is gone. It is available on the hosted server too, through a
  per-tool allowlist, and is the only destructive tool the hosted server offers.
- **Profiles**: `get_family_members` prints profile IDs. `send_message` takes
  `to` (profile names) to send to specific people, and `create_calendar_event`
  and `update_calendar_event` take `profiles`. Names are matched exactly
  (case-insensitive, no prefix matching); an unknown name fails with the list of
  valid names and sends nothing.
- README: a support matrix, a Not supported list, a Skylight API calls table, and
  a test that fails if a tool is missing from the README or its effect differs.

### Fixed

- **Event times were stored 7 hours early.** A start or end time with no UTC
  offset was read by Skylight as UTC, so 8:00 AM was stored as 1:00 AM Pacific.
  Local times now get the frame's UTC offset (daylight saving aware) on create and
  update. Times that already carry an offset or Z, and all-day dates, are unchanged.
  Events created with earlier versions are still wrong in Skylight and need
  correcting by hand.
- A response with an empty body (the message delete) no longer throws "Unexpected
  end of JSON input".

## [1.5.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added

- **Meals**: `update_meal_sitting` (write) renames or moves a scheduled meal, or
  changes its note or category, and `delete_meal_sitting` (destructive, local
  server only) removes one. Both use the web app's own calls:
  `PATCH` and `DELETE` on `/meals/sittings/{id}/instances/{date}`, sent with the
  newer `Skylight-Api-Version` (`2026-10-15`). The edit sends the whole form, with
  unchanged fields read back first. A move keeps the current date in the path and
  puts the new date in the body. Only one-off meals are supported; repeating meals
  are refused and left to the Skylight app, because editing one occurrence of a
  series was not captured. `delete_meal_sitting` previews unless `confirm: true`
  and only reports success when Skylight lists the sitting in
  `meta.deleted_sitting_ids`. Sitting IDs and dates are format-checked before they
  reach a URL path.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-10-29

### Fixed

- **Messages**: `get_messages` showed every message as "selected devices" and listed
  profile names instead of "everyone", and `update_message` would have refused
  every message. Messages need the newer `Skylight-Api-Version` that the web app
  sends (`2026-10-15`); under the repo-wide older version the responses omit
  `all_profiles`, `all_devices` and `voice_kind`. The messages endpoints now send
  the newer version; every other endpoint is unchanged.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-10-29

### Added

- **Messages**: `get_messages` (read) and `send_message` (write) for the notes
  shown on the frame. Endpoint and payload were taken from the web app's own
  calls. Sends are silent unless `readAloud` is set, go to everyone on all
  devices, and are capped at 300 characters. Skylight offers no way to delete a
  message, so `send_message` previews by default and posts only with an explicit
  `confirm: true` after the user has approved the text. Presigned audio URLs, which carry
  temporary storage credentials, are never returned.

- `update_message` edits a message's text or sender (PATCH with the whole form, as
  the web app does) for messages sent to everyone on all devices that don't repeat.
  Message IDs are validated as numeric before they reach a URL path.

### Not yet supported

- Targeting specific profiles or devices, scheduling, repeats and voice notes.
  The request fields for these have not been captured.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-10-29

### Added

- **Planning tools**: `get_week_overview`, `find_conflicts`, `find_free_slots`
  (all read-only) and `plan_week_meals` (write, with dry run). Chores and
  tasks are first-class in the overview: status, assignee, points, and an
  overdue section.
- `src/utils/schedule.ts`: zone-aware interval math (Intl only, no library)
  with explicit handling of DST gaps/overlaps and all-day events.
- Tests for the schedule math and the four planning tools.

### Notes

- `plan_week_meals` registers without Plus and fails with a clear message there.
- The hosted Worker exposes the new tools automatically (read + write profile).
  Redeploy to pick them up.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-29

### Fixed

- **Meals**: `get_meal_categories` showed every category as "Unknown"; the
  API field is `label`, not `name`. `get_meal_sittings` now shows what is
  planned (summary or recipe), the category name, and each date in range.
  `create_meal_sitting` accepts a free-text `summary` so a meal can be
  scheduled without creating a recipe first, and reads the list-shaped
  create response correctly.

### Added

- **Browser-paste sign-in**: `skylight-mcp auth login` / `auth complete <url>` /
  `auth status` / `auth logout`. You sign in in your own browser and paste the
  redirect URL; the password never reaches the server. PKCE (S256) and a
  state check bound to a short-lived `0600` pending-login file.
- **Encrypted credential store**: AES-256-GCM with the key in macOS Keychain;
  `0600` file store elsewhere. Fails closed when the Keychain is unavailable.
- Automatic access-token refresh with rotation persisted; one in-flight
  refresh shared across concurrent requests; one retry on 401.
- Tests for the OAuth module, both credential stores, client auth order,
  API host pinning, the tool registry, request context and the hosted MCP
  handler (82 total).

- **Hosted server for Claude Duet** (`src/worker/`, `wrangler.jsonc`): a
  Cloudflare Worker that is both OAuth authorization server and MCP resource
  server (`@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` 1.x). Consent page gated by a
  setup passphrase; the same browser-paste Skylight sign-in, with the PKCE
  verifier held in a browser-bound upstream transaction; Skylight tokens kept
  in encrypted grant props and refreshed in `tokenExchangeCallback`. Exposes
  read + create/update tools only.
- `src/context.ts`: per-request AsyncLocalStorage context so one process can
  serve many grants; `src/tools/registry.ts`: effect classification and MCP
  annotations for every tool.

### Changed

- Package renamed to `@dwooods/skylight-mcp`; repository metadata points at
  this fork. README carries an explicit unofficial-status notice.
- Auth source order is now explicit token, stored credential, then the
  deprecated email/password login. Startup no longer requires email/password or
  token env vars.
- The client refuses absolute endpoint URLs whose origin is not the Skylight API
  host, so a bearer token can never be sent elsewhere.
- README, SECURITY.md and `.env.example` rewritten for the new flow.
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` credits kamilio/skylight-calendar-agent (MIT), whose
  design informed the sign-in flow and credential store.

### Security

- `npm audit`: 24 → 0. Runtime: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.25 → 1.32
  (GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7, cross-client data leak via shared transport reuse;
  this server already creates one server+transport per request) and `zod`
  3 → 4 (GHSA-mrhx-c7xc-m3w5). Dev: `vitest` 1 → 5, `vite` 8, `@types/node`
  22.

### Removed

- Node 18 support (end-of-life April 2025; `wrangler` needs 20+). `engines` is now `>=20`.

### Deprecated

- `SKYLIGHT_EMAIL` / `SKYLIGHT_PASSWORD` login.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Authentication**: Updated email/password authentication to match Skylight's current web OAuth flow. The server now follows the browser login sequence (`/oauth/authorize` -> `/auth/session` -> `/oauth/token`) and uses the returned bearer token for API requests.

### Changed

- Centralized shared API constants, including the Skylight API version header
- Updated auth-related docs and error guidance to reflect OAuth-based login
- Added automated tests for the OAuth login flow and kept live smoke validation against the real API

## [1.1.7] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed

- **Authentication**: Fixed email/password authentication to use correct `Basic base64(userId:token)` format instead of `Bearer token`. The Skylight API requires the user ID and token to be combined and base64-encoded for Basic auth.
- **Calendar Events**: Fixed `get_calendar_events` returning no events when querying a single day. The API treats `date_max` as exclusive, so we now add 1 day to ensure events on the end date are included.

### Changed

- Added debug logging for authentication flow to help troubleshoot login issues
- Added automatic retry on 401 errors for email/password auth (attempts re-login once before failing)

## [1.1.6] - 2025-12-29

- Initial public release
